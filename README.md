# WindowsSetup
InstallChocoAndApps.ps1 is an install-script that installs [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install) and a couple of apps I want on a fresh system.

To use this script, navigate to the directory where you saved it and then run the following command from an administrator shell:

````ps1
  .\InstallChocoAndApps.ps1
````

_Feel free to use and modify this script as you wish for your own setup!_
